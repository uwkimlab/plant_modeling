These resistences are connected in series along the $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ diffusional pathway. Hence, the sum of all resistences determine the total resistence ($r_t$).

That is, we use $g_b$ for boudary later conductance, $g_s$ for stomatal conductance, and $g_m$ for mesophyll conductance that lumps all internal conductances (i.e., intercellular spaces, cell wall, and liquid phase) together. $g_t$ is the total conductance that combines all counductances.
