    "Previously, you built a model to simulate the growth of a whole-plant using the relative growth rate (RGR) along that showed an exponential growth pattern and later in combination with a known final size using the logistic equation. Here, you will modify and expand the model to represent some basic physiological mechanisms. In the logistic growth model, we assumed that the growth rate slows down as the plant reaches its potential biomass (this is analogous to running out of space or resources in a density dependent population). There could be other reasons for plants to slow down their growth rate. One possible mechanism is that the efficiency of growth may decline over time as the plant ages. For example, the efficiency of resource acquisition and use (e.g. light) per carbon invested in foliage tissue will slow down as plants grow bigger with increasingly overlapping foliage that results in self-shading. In addition, the efficacy of a leaf, even if it's not shaded, for producing photosynthates would also decline over time as the leaf ages. At the lower level of organizations, a constant turn over of tissues, cells, proteins and metabolites takes place. That is, old tissue, cells, or molecules die or degrade while new tissue, cells, or molecules are synthesized. Here we will explore some of the simple but physiologically meaningful ways to model realistic plant growth patterns. As done in the previous examples, we will be simulating biomass accumulation of a whole-plant from seed to maturity for an annual crop."

Photosynthesis assimilates CO<sub>2</sub> to provide carbohydrates as the substrate for respiration. Respiration breaks down the photosynthates to supply energy needed for maintenance of existing biomass as well as C skeletons and energy needed for construction of new biomass (growth).

    "Both models are simple but robustly grounded in physiology to provide critical insights for understanding the intricate relationship between these three processes and their trade-offs determining plant growth. The trade-offs of allocating photosynthates between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic parts can be particularly insightful and relevant for the growth of crops like lettuce and cabbage for which the foliage biomass accounts for the majority of harvested yield or crops with large underground storage organs like radish, potato, garlic, and onions. Carbon allocation to non-photosynthetic parts is also functionally important in  herbaceous perennials with storage organs such as rhizomes and woody plants for which dead parts (i.e. wood and bark) continue to be part of the whole-plant biomass."

Use the parameters and their values listed in Table~\\ref{table:1} as appropriate for your model. Answer the following questions using your model or based on your model.\n",

When is the maximum biomass reached and what is that biomass? Do the values look reasonable for the species of your choice based on your knowledge about the plant? \n",

What breeding strategies (e.g., increase photosynthesis, increase leaf area) would you use? Can you test your ideas using the model you just developed? How? If not, why not?\n",
