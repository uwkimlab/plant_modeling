Calibrate the Chanter model in derivative form (differential equation) OR in integrated form (analytical solution) with total shoot biomass data (`shootDM`). $r$ and $\\alpha$ are the same as in the Gompertz function. $B$ parameter here may be interpreted as potential biomass representing the genetic ceiling that can be reached when no loss in growth efficiency occurs (i.e., $\\alpha$ = 0). Provide the parameter estimates for best fit, and discuss their biological meanings. How many parameters did you end up calibrating and why?\n",

    "Sometimes we may not need or wish to calibrate all parameters in a model at the same time. It may even be preferable to determine a parameter value based on the literature or prior knowledge instead of going through calibration process in some cases especially if those prior values are based on solid biological understandings and/or data are limited for reliable calibration. For example, it is relatively simple to determine the seed mass of corn before planting. Here, we will use seed mass ($W_0$) of 0.275g as an example. This value is based on our prior knowledge of the mass of a corn kernel.  This will help us reduce the number of prameters to calibrate. This might sacrifice the fitness (e.g., RMSE) a little but that's ok and we can determine how much fitness is lost, and whether it was worth it. There could be multiple ways to do this. Let's think about how we can achieve this in `Cropbox`.\n"
