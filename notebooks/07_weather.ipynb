The **atmospheric concentrations of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$** (\\[$\\mathrm{CO_2}$\\]) is particularly important for plants because that's the food they assimilate to sugar through photosynthesis but the majority of weather stations do not monitor \\[$\\mathrm{CO_2}$\\] likely because it is not a typical variable that influences or changes short-term weather whereas the global climate has been changing at an unprecedented rate because of rapidly rising atmospheric \\[$\\mathrm{CO_2}$\\]. The \\[$\\mathrm{CO_2}$\\] varies considerably diurnally, seasonally, and spatially as well and is a critical variable that is missing from data collected by most weather stations. Many earlier crop models did not include $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ as a driving variable to simulate plant growth largely because it was assumed to be stable and also it was lacking from the weather data. But most modern plant models include \\[$\\mathrm{CO_2}$\\] as a key input variable; when locally measured values are unavailabe the global average can be used (i.e., 427 $\\mathrm{\\mu mol}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$ measured at [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/)).

        "### Working with `hourly` weather data ###\n",
        "In `Cropbox` the default time step is hourly. That is because the physiological processes vary dynamically over a day. Capturing these dynamics is important because physiological and biochemical responses to light, temperature, and other environmental variables are often non-linear. Plant growth models running on daily or coarser time step oftem assume linear responses of plant growth and development to light and temperature. We have seen the examples in RUE and GDD models previously. The assumed linear relationships are likely to break in extreme weather conditions (e.g., high emperatures causing heat stress, saturating light). On the other hand, a downside of plant growth models at hourly or finer intervals is that they impose a greater computation load and take longer to run. This is particularly true for tree or forest growth models that run from decades to centurires in hourly time step. Another consideration is the availability and quality of weather data for a desired location and frequency. More oftren than not, weather stations have missing data for sensor failure and other reasons and the missing values need to be gap filled before they can be used for running plant growth models.\n",

        "There is a weather station at UW Center for Urban Horticulture (CUH) that is maintained by the AgWeatherNet (<https://weather.wsu.edu/>). We will work with hourly weather data (file: UW-CUH_2014-2021.csv) downloaded from the weather station. This dataset includes weather data from 2014 to 2021 formatted to include weather data collected for 8 years from 2014 to 2021 with varibles inlcuded in the `Weather_hourly` system we create later.\n",

We will call this function to read a weather file in CSV (or other delimited) format to `provide` a dataframe that can be used to `drive` plant growth modeling.
