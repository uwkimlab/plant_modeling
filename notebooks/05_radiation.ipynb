        "The atmospheric and soil conditions dictate plant growth and health. A reasonable whole-plant model should be able to mimic how plants respond and interact with the environment. In this and following two topics, we will review some of the fundamentals of biometeorology (or agrometeorology) relevant for modeling plant growth and development. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's first clarify the use of key terms, concepts, and definitions. We would feed `weather` data to run a plant growth model. Weather data can come in many different forms and intervals. Most crop models, for example, run on a daily time-step and would require weather data organize in daily values (e.g., mean, max, and min temperatures). Other models including those models based on organ-level processes (e.g., leaf photosynthesis) run on houly or shorter intervals. The hourly models are useful to study and represent the dynamic response patterns over a diurnal course that will be missed in models with daily or longer time steps. For trees that live centuries, however, a longer interval such as monthly time-step may be more appropriate unless investigating dynamc physiological responses happening at a much smaller and finer scale in space and time is of the main interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "While weather represents the short-term changes in the atmospheric environment, `climate` refers to long-term measures of the atemospheric events that are often expressed in 30 year averages known as `climate normals`. Agricultural researchers often use crop simulation models to study the impacts of climate change on crop yield and plant productivity in the future. To use a crop simulation model to predict crop productivity in the future, one would first need to obtain the projected future climate data from climate models in coarser time and spatial scales, then process the data through statisal or dynamic downscaling and interpolation in both time (e.g., from monthly to daily and hourly) and space to run plant models at the desired scale.\n",

Because light travels and behaves as both particles and waves, radiatve energy ($e$ in Joule (J)) transfered by the packets of photons depend on their wavelength according to:\n",

The amount of photons falling onto unit surface area is expressed as photon flux density in moles of photons per unit area over a time interval (i.e., $\\mathrm{\\mu mol}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$). This allows us to convert moles of photons to radiative energy (J) and vice versa for different wavelengths (i.e., colors) of light coming from different sources (e.g., natural sunlight, LED, High Pressure Sodium and other artificial lightings). See Chapters 10 and 11 of [Campbell and Norman (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-1626-1) for more information.\n",

        "Most solar radiation is short-wave radiation (280 to 4000 nm) with about 45% of energy coming as **photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 300-700 nm)** and approx. 50% in near infrared (NIR; 700-2500 nm). Solar radiation is usually measured by silicon-cell pyranometers that sense a portion of the solar spectrum (e.g., 300 - 1100 nm; \\~80% of total) but calibrated to approximate the total solar radiation. PAR is expressed in energy unit as $\\mathrm{W/m^2}$ where $\\mathrm{W = J/s}$. The light energy is transfered by packets of photons with respect to their wavelength as shown above. The amount of photons coming specifically in PAR waveband is termed **photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD or PFD)**. Conversion between PAR ($\\mathrm{W/m^2}$) and PFD ($\\mathrm{\\mu mol}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$) is possible and the conversion factor varies with the spectrum of light source. For PAR from natural sun light, the median wavelength is 550 nm and the conversion between PAR and PFD is approximated to be **0.218 J/μmol or 4.6 μmol/J** as we saw in Ex 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "A useful metric in horticulture is **Daily light integral (DLI)**. DLI represents the amount of photons in PAR per day per unit area ($\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ d^{-1}}$). In other words, DLI is a sum of PFD ($\\mathrm{μmol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$) integrated over a day.\n",

The radiation from the sun represented by the solar constant ($S_c$ = 1367 $\\mathrm{W/m^2}$) is fairly constant except with the cyclic variations due to sunspot activities but the actual solar radiation incident on the earth's surface ($S$) varies with time and location and the variations are predictable. The incident solar radiation varies diurnally and seasonally because of earth's orbital eccentricity and rotation, by locations with respect to latitude and longitude, and also due to the atmospheric transmissivity ($\\tau$) which depends on cloudiness. The cyclic variabilities associated with the solar geometry can be approximated by a set of equations as summarized below ([Goudriaan and van Laar, 1994; Chapter 3](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-0750-1_3)):\n",

        "As people say, plants eat light to grow although I think it is more correct to say that plants eat $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ with their countless mouths (stomata). Anyways, the concept of radiation use efficiency proposed by [Monteith (1977)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1977.0140) is useful in this regard. It is  simple and elegant but empirical. Based on the thermodynamic efficiency of a crop canopy to convert the light energy ($\\mathrm{MJ \\cdot m^{-2}}$ in short-wave solar radiation) into the chemical energy to produce carbohydrates forming crop biomass ($\\mathrm{g m^{-2}}$ in dry matter), it has been proposed that RUE remains conserved for different crops and environmental conditions. Later works provided theoretical underpinnings of this approach Loomis [(1999)](https://doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1999.3961584x). The RUE approach can be summarized as:\n",

For other ecosystems (e.g., forest, desert), this quantity will be equivalent to the net primary productivity (NPP) for a given year. In both cases, the leaf area index (LAI) needs to be known as a parameter or an input variable, which is often estimated using remote sensing data. Once final biomass accumulated over the season is known, the harvested crop yield ($Y_h$) can be obtained if harvest index ($h$) of the crop is known. The $h$ for a highly domesticated and bred grain crop (e.g., corn, rice, wheat) may be up to 50% or greater.\n",

        "As discussed, the radiation (or light) use efficiency (RUE or LUE) is a simple but useful concept in plant growth modeling that many crop models are based on.

First, some simplifying **assumptions** that are likely unrealistic but necessary: 1) **the leaf area index (LAI)** of the canopy stayed at **3.0** throughout the season, 2) the canopy light **extinction coeffcient (**$\\textbf{k}$) was **0.6**, and 3) **daily short-wave solar radiation (**$I_0$) was constant at **25** $\\mathrm{MJ~d^{-1}}$ for the entire corn growing season of **100 days** in **Ames, Iowa**.
