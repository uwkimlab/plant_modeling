For example, if we assume that a plant grows through cell division and expansion at a rate proportional to the existing cells and their biomass with little to no physical or physiological limitations, the early growth rate is likely to resemble that of the exponential growth growth. However, as the plant grows bigger and taller the growth rate will slow down. This may be because the plant is approaching its ceiling for height and biomass that's controlled by genetic, physiological, or physcal limits (e.g., potential biomass, $W_f$; maximal height, $H_f$).

        "Now let's think about the parameters and variables of the logistic growth model (@eq-logistic). What is the state variable? How many parameters are there? Do the parameters have biological meaning? Are they measurable, observable, or at least imaginable? $W$ is the plant biomass (dry mass in gram) whose state changes over time as plant grows. Thus, it is a *state variable* of this model. $W_0$ is the initial biomass that can be determined by measuring seed mass (g). It has clear meaning and unit, and can be assumed to remain the same for a species or cultivar; it is a *parameter* in this model system. How about $r$ defined previously as 'relative growth rate'? It is likely to remain unchanged for the same plant or genotype (e.g., clone, cultivar, species) can be characterized by its genetics. It will be influenced by its environment but if we assume a constant environment, then it is a unique value for the plant that doesn't change over time. So, it's another *parameter* here. How can we determine the value of $r$? This is where calibration or model fitting comes in to play a role. Note that the actual rate of growth as *rate* represented by $dW/dt$ is not identical to $r$ because it slows down over time as the plant reaches its final size or biomass ($W_f$). The final biomass $W_f$ is an interesting *parameter* that may or may not be easily determined. If it is used to represent the potential biomass of a plant that can be reached only in an optimal growth condition with unlimited resources, then it should signify the genetic ceiling of the plant. How do we measure that in practice or can we ever? In practice, we can determine the values of these parameters ($W_0, r, W_f$) through *model calibration* process using some sort of optimization techniques especially if we have sufficient observational data over a wide range of plants' growth stages. Therefore, it is often useful to have observations spread over time than having more observations concentrated only on few time points. For example, if you have limited time and resources to make only 100 observations, then having 5 reps over 20 time points will work better for calibrating (i.e., fitting) the model to estimate parameter values than having 20 reps over 5 times or 50 reps over only 2 times. This is even more true if a model is complex with many parameters to fit. Whether or not the observations we have best represent the true meaning of the model parameters is something to think about. See@Paine2012 for further discussion.\n",

The Gompertz, Chanter, and Richards equations are other growth functions depicting the sigmoidal growth patterns with biologically meaningful parameters, representing different assumptions and constraints of growth. See Ch 3 of @Thornley2000 for details. Another interesting growth function is one derived from the beta distribution model @Yin2003.\n",
