        "Previously, we modeled the growth of a whole-plant using a logistic function characterized by an early exponential growth phase, a linear phase, and a later saturating phase to reach the final biomass. Here, we will modify and expand the model to represent some basic physiological processes. That is, we are going to make our model a little more mechanistic. In the logistic growth model, we assumed that the growth rate slows down as the plant reaches its potential biomass (this is analogous to running out of space or resources in a density dependent population). There could be other reasons or mechanisms for plants to slow down their growth as they mature. One possible mechanism is that the efficiency of growth may decline over time as the plant ages. For example, the efficiency of resource acquisition and use (e.g. light) per carbon invested in foliage tissue will slow down as plants grow bigger with increasingly overlapping foliage that results in self-shading. In addition, the efficacy of a leaf, even if it's not shaded, for producing photosynthates would also decline over time as the leaf ages. At the lower level of organizations, a constant turn over of tissues, cells, proteins and metabolites takes place. That is, old tissue, cells, or molecules die or degrade while new tissue, cells, or molecules are synthesized. Here we will explore some of the simple but physiologically meaningful ways to model realistic plant growth patterns. As done in the previous examples, we will be simulating biomass accumulation of a whole-plant from seed to maturity for an annual plant.\n",

        "Before we move further ahead, let's take a look at some basic physiology of how an organism could accumulate (gain) or dissipate (lose) its biomass through gas-exchange. This would apply to both animals and plants. We just need to remember the law of conservation of mass, remind ourselves that gases have their own mass, and practice the skill to balance input and output of mass through stoichiometry of chemical elements like managing your bank account. In plants, we do this mass balancing based on carbon as its currency because carbon is one of the most abundant chemical elements forming plant biomass, and its concentration (mass/mass) is consistent within organ types (e.g., leaf, stem, root, fruit, seeds) and conserved within functional groups and taxa. Across different taxa, carbon concentration in plants stays between 40% and 50% with 45 % being a reasonable approximation for most parts and taxa [@Ma2018; @Taiz2018]. Herbaceous plants tend to have lower carbon content ($\\approx 42$ %) while trees, and conifers in particular, tend to have higher carbon content ($\\approx 50$ %) [@Ma2018]. The majority of carbon goes in and out of plants as gas through photosynthesis (a.k.a., assimilation) and respiration. For this reason modeling gas-exchange processes become fundamental in plant ecophysiological models [@Kim2020]. While somewhat underappreciated presumably, carbon lost through respiration can also account for a substantial amount of biomass (or weight) loss in animals and humans\n",

Allocation or partitioning of the photosynthates is a critical component that affects the rate of plant growth because it determines the destination and fate of these substrates about how and where they are used. For example, some assimilates will be transported to roots to function as substrates for providing ATPs to maintain the ion gradients while others can be invested back to build more new leaves. More investment in photosynthetic machinery (i.e. allocation to foliage) will yield greater return of biomass at a faster rate; this may be analogous to re-investing the earnings to buy more assets in the market.\n",

Carbon allocation to non-photosynthetic parts is also functionally important in herbaceous perennials with storage organs such as rhizomes and woody plants for which non-living tissues (i.e. wood and bark) continue to be part of the whole-plant biomass.

        "\n",
        "A notable modeling approach for carbon partitioning applies the concept of *sink regulations* [@Marcelis1996]. This approach partitions assimilates among plant organs based on their *sink strength*, which is defined as the competitive ability or potential capacity of an organ for assimilate accumulation [@Marcelis1996]. In this model, the fraction ($f$) of biomass partitioned into $i_{\\mathrm{th}}$ sink organ is determined by its sink strength ($S_i$) as:\n",

        "$$\n",
        "    f_i = \\frac{S_i}{\\sum S} \\approx \\frac{Y_{pot,i}}{\\sum Y_{pot}}\n",
        "$${#eq-sink-strength}\n",
        "\n",
        "This model illustrates that biomass partitioning (i.e., fractional distribution of biomass) to an organ varies with its competitive sink strength among all sinks which may be be approximated by the potential growth rate of the organ ($Y_{pot,i}$) relative to the total (i.e., sum of all) potential growth rate as shown in @eq-sink-strength. This particular case assumes that all sinks have the same affinity (or get the same priority) for assimilates. The potential growth rate ($Y_{pot,i}$) of sink organ $i$ can be modeled using a sigmoidal growth function such as logistic, Gompertz, Chanter, or Richards function. When the affinity for assimilates differs between organs, @eq-sink-strength can be expanded to account for variable responses to assimilate supply between organs with differing affinity using a function like the Michaelis-Menten equation [@Marcelis1994]. This *sink priority* model by [@Marcelis1994] relies on the simplifying assumption that the source (or transport) path is non-dominant in regulating dry-matter partitioning [@Marcelis1998].\n",
        "\n",
        "A different approach that accounts for the *transport-resistance* network from source to sink is to simulate the phloem transport of assimilates based on Ernst Munch's hypothesis of bulk flow, in which assimilates are driven by an osmotically generated pressure gradient between source and sink organs and the kinetics of assimilate unloading at the sink [@Minchin1993; @Minchin2005].\n",

The models we've looked at so far do not account for this aspect of senescence and death.
