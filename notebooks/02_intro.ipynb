Some functions (*i.e.* `simulate()`, `instance()`) used in this notebook were simply called without module name (*i.e.* `Cropbox.`), while some had to be called with a prefix (*e.g.* `Cropbox.hierarchy()`, `Cropbox.source()`). By default, the latter group of functions are not exported to the user scope, because they were mostly designed for internal use and their forms and behaviors are likely to change in the future. So please be mindful when you need to use them.\n",
